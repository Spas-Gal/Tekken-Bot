# Tekken-Bot
A bot for playing the game Tekken.

**Features:** auto-duck, auto-parry (for characters Jin and Leroy only), auto-throw-break, side-switch awareness, and macros for auto-Korean Backdash, auto-wavedash, and working code for auto-counterhit (currently deactivated)

# Controls

Hold shift to activate the auto-block and auto-duck.

Hold Numpad1 to activate an automatic Jin parry for high and mid attacks, and an automatic low parry for low attacks.

The auto-throw break is always on.



# Requirements
Visual Studio 2022 (preferably), a Windows computer, a copy of the game Tekken.

# Setup

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the project in Visual Studio 2022 (or another IDE or C++ compiler), make any changes, and compile the project
3. Run the generated project executable


# Features in the future

- Implement/extend the GUI code so controls are more configurable
- Add automatic power-crush and automatic punch-parry
- Create database/data structure containing counter moves for each character (like a list of punch parries for each character, a list of launchers)
